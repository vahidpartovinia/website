\section{Optimization}
\begin{exercise}
Show that  $S(\bbeta) = (\y-\X\bbeta)\t  (\y-\X\bbeta)$ is a convex function.
\end{exercise}

\end{solution}


\section{Implementation} Install Anaconda 3 (along with Python 3.6). Use ``jupiter notebook" to execute your python codes.
\begin{exercise} Copy paste the following code in your jupyter notebook and upload the grphs for polynomial order=1, order=2, order=3. You may play with the order from 1 to 10 and let me know which order think is a better fit? Why?
\newpage
\begin{verbatim}
# library for data handling and statistics 
import pandas as pd
# library for numerical computation
import numpy as np
# library for plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# library for plot style
import seaborn as sns
# put plots in jupyter window
%matplotlib inline
# define the path of data
PATH = 'http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv'
# read a CSV data file
advertising = pd.read_csv(PATH, usecols=[1,2,3,4])
# seaborn plot
sns.regplot(advertising.TV, advertising.sales, order=3, ci=None, scatter_kws={'color':'r', 's':9})

# control axes 
plt.xlim(-10,310)
plt.ylim(ymin=0);

\section{Mathematical Statistics} 
\begin{exercise} In this exercise you see that the mean and the median both impose a constant model on data, but the constant is estimated differently.
\begin{itemize}
\item Show that the mean is the minimizer of of the constant model $y_i = \beta_0 +\varepsilon_i$, using $S(\beta_0) = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0)^2$ 
\item Show that the median is the minimizer of of the constant model $y_i = \beta_0 +\varepsilon_i$, using $S(\beta_0) = \sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \beta_0|$ 
\item Construct a loss function $S(\beta_0)$ that produces the trimmed-mean as $\hat\beta_0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}


\begin{exercise} 
Show maximum likelihood estimator for linear model $y_i=\x_i\t \beta + \varepsilon_i $ coincides with the least squares if  $\varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, for a known $\sigma^2$.

\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Recommend a density function for $\varepsilon_i$ that leads to median regression. Median regression minimizes $S(\bbeta) = \sum_{i=1}^n|\y_i - \x_i\t\bbeta|$
\end{exercise}

\section{Computation}

\begin{exercise}
How do you compute the least squares estimator  $\hat\bbeta$ using for a given response vector $\y$ and design matrix $\X$
\begin{itemize}
\item LU decomposition
\item QR decomposition
\item SVD decomposition
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
